# Java Spring Boot Projects

This repository contains a Java Spring Boot project developed and maintained by Prathmesh311.

## Overview

The project is a Spring Boot application designed for managing and displaying Spring Boot learning projects. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for avatars using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several subprojects, each focusing on different aspects of the application:

- `Dependancy-injection`: This subproject contains code related to dependency injection. It may include configurations, classes, or components responsible for managing the injection of dependencies within the application.

- `SpringCRUD`: The `SpringCRUD` subproject contains code related to basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can find code for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records/entities in this module.

- `SpringCRUDwithDataJPA`: This subproject extends the CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA. It provides more advanced and efficient ways to perform CRUD operations by leveraging JPA repositories.

- `SpringRest`: The `SpringRest` subproject focuses on building RESTful APIs within the Spring Boot application. You will find code related to defining API endpoints, request and response handling, and RESTful best practices.

- `hibernateJpa`: The `hibernateJpa` subproject contains code related to Hibernate JPA. It may include entity classes, mappings, and configurations specific to Hibernate JPA.

Please navigate to each subproject directory for more detailed information and specific instructions on how to work with that part of the application.
